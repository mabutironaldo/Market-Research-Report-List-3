<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air-Cooled Turbogenerators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>2-PoleAir-CooledGenerators</li><li>4-PoleAir-CooledGenerators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Air-cooled turbogenerators can be classified into two main types based on the number of poles: 2-pole air-cooled generators and 4-pole air-cooled generators. The 2-pole generators are designed to operate at higher speeds and are more compact, making them suitable for applications requiring high power output in a small footprint. On the other hand, 4-pole generators operate at lower speeds and are used in applications where a slower speed is preferred, such as in industrial settings or grid stabilization.</p></p>
