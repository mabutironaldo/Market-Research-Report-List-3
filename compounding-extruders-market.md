<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Compounding Extruders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Twin-Screw</li><li>Single-Screw</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Compounding extruders are machines used in the plastics industry to mix, melt, and process materials. There are two main types of compounding extruders: twin-screw and single-screw. Twin-screw extruders have two intermeshing screws that provide better mixing and processing of materials, making them suitable for a wide range of applications. Single-screw extruders have a single rotating screw that pushes materials through a heated barrel, typically used for simpler and lower viscosity materials. Both types of extruders play a crucial role in the production of various plastic products.</p></p>
