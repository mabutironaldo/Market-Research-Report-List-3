<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Controlled-release Fertilizers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sulphur-coated urea (SCU)</li><li>Polymer-coated products</li><li>Polymer/ Sulphur-coated products</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Controlled-release fertilizers are designed to gradually release nutrients to plants over an extended period of time, reducing the frequency of application and potential nutrient loss. There are three main types of controlled-release fertilizers: Sulphur-coated urea (SCU), which encases urea with a layer of sulphur to control release; Polymer-coated products, which use a polymer coating to regulate nutrient release; and Polymer/Sulphur-coated products, which combine both polymer and sulphur coatings for enhanced control over nutrient release. Each type offers unique benefits for specific agricultural needs.</p></p>
