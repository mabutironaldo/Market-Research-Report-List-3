<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lipoprotein Apheresis Absorbance Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cellulose Gel</li><li>Sepharose</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Lipoprotein Apheresis Absorbance often utilizes two main types of absorbent materials in the market: Cellulose Gel and Sepharose. Cellulose Gel is a commonly used material that is effective in removing lipoproteins from the blood by trapping them within its porous structure. On the other hand, Sepharose is a gel-based material that also efficiently captures lipoproteins through its unique composition. Both materials play a crucial role in the process of lipoprotein apheresis by effectively reducing the levels of lipoproteins in the blood.</p></p>
