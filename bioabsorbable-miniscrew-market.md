<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bioabsorbable Miniscrew Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PLLA Miniscrews</li><li>PGA Miniscrews</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bioabsorbable miniscrews are commonly used in orthodontic treatments for anchorage reinforcement. PLLA (Poly-L-lactic acid) miniscrews are one type of bioabsorbable material that gradually degrades in the body over time. On the other hand, PGA (Polyglycolic acid) miniscrews are another type of bioabsorbable material used in orthodontic treatments. Both PLLA and PGA miniscrews offer the advantage of not requiring removal after treatment, as they are naturally absorbed by the body. These bioabsorbable miniscrews provide a convenient and effective solution for orthodontic anchorage.</p></p>
