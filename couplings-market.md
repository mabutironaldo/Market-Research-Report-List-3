<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Couplings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Shifting</li><li>Shifting</li><li>Hydrodynamic</li><li>Magnetic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>There are four main types of couplings in the market: non-shifting, shifting, hydrodynamic, and magnetic. Non-shifting couplings are simple and rigid, used when the two shafts need to be always in alignment. Shifting couplings allow for some misalignment and flexibility. Hydrodynamic couplings use fluid to transmit power, allowing for smooth engagement. Magnetic couplings use magnetic fields to transfer torque, ideal for applications where physical contact is not desired. Each type of coupling has its own set of advantages and uses in different industries.</p></p>
