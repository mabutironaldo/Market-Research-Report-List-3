<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Water Deionizers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Two-bed Deionization</li><li>Mixed-bed Deionization</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Industrial water deionizers market consists of two main types: two-bed deionization and mixed-bed deionization. Two-bed deionization involves separate beds of cation and anion exchange resins, which effectively remove ions from water. On the other hand, mixed-bed deionization combines both resins into a single bed, resulting in higher purity water due to the thorough mixing of cations and anions. Both types of deionization processes are crucial in industries where high-quality water is required for various applications.</p></p>
