<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water Based Water Repellent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Combining Type</li><li>Non-combining Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Water based water repellents can be classified into two main types: combining type and non-combining type. Combining type water repellents are designed to mix with water, forming a chemical bond with the substrate to create a durable barrier against moisture. On the other hand, non-combining type water repellents repel water by creating a surface barrier that repels water molecules. Both types offer effective protection against water damage, but they achieve this through different mechanisms.</p></p>
