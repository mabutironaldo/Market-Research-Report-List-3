<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gas-insulated Transformers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Full-insulated Transformers</li><li>Semi-insulated Transformers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gas-insulated transformers are categorized into two types: Full-insulated transformers and Semi-insulated transformers. Full-insulated transformers have all internal components, including windings and the core, enclosed in a sealed tank filled with insulating gas, providing maximum protection against environmental factors. Semi-insulated transformers have certain components, such as the windings, partially exposed to the environment but still enclosed in a gas-insulated tank. Both types offer superior performance and reliability compared to traditional oil-insulated transformers, making them ideal for critical power distribution applications.</p></p>
