<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The BLE Module Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Mode BLE Modules</li><li>Dual-Mode BLE Modules</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Single-Mode BLE Modules are designed for low-energy applications that only require BLE connectivity. These modules are more cost-effective and have a longer battery life compared to Dual-Mode BLE Modules. Dual-Mode BLE Modules, on the other hand, support both BLE and classic Bluetooth connectivity, making them suitable for applications that require compatibility with older Bluetooth devices. They are more versatile but may consume more power and cost more than Single-Mode BLE Modules. Both types cater to different market needs and applications within the BLE module market.</p></p>
