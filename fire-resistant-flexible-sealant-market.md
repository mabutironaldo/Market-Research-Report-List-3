<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Resistant Flexible Sealant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Elastometric Type</li><li>Intumescent Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fire-resistant flexible sealants are essential for preventing the spread of fire between compartments in buildings. There are two main types of fire-resistant sealants: Elastomeric type and Intumescent type. Elastomeric sealants are rubber-like and can withstand high temperatures, maintaining their flexibility and effectiveness during a fire. Intumescent sealants swell up when exposed to heat, forming an insulating layer that helps to protect the surrounding structures. Both types play a crucial role in fire safety by containing flames and smoke within a building.</p></p>
