<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wired Aviation Headset Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Noise Reduction (PNR) Headsets</li><li>Active Noise Reduction (ANR) Headsets</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Passive Noise Reduction (PNR) Headsets are designed to block out ambient noise through soundproofing materials and ear cup design. They are a more affordable option and effectively reduce overall noise levels by physically blocking out external sounds. On the other hand, Active Noise Reduction (ANR) Headsets use electronic technology to produce sound waves that cancel out ambient noise, providing a more advanced level of noise reduction. ANR headsets are typically more expensive but offer superior noise-cancelling capabilities for a quieter and more comfortable flying experience.</p></p>
