<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The AC Current Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed-Loop Current Sensors</li><li>Open Loop Current Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>AC Current Sensors are used to measure and monitor the flow of current in electrical systems. Closed-loop current sensors provide higher accuracy and are best suited for applications requiring precise measurements, as they have a feedback mechanism that adjusts the output based on the input signal. Open-loop current sensors are more cost-effective and easier to install, but offer slightly lower accuracy as they do not have a feedback mechanism. Both types play a crucial role in ensuring the safe and efficient operation of electrical systems.</p></p>
